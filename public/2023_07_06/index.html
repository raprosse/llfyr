What are the non work things I need to be doing?

Book an MRI. Probably the largest outstanding personal item that I haven&rsquo;t addressed.
Do some stretching. Journey of a million miles and all that.
I&rsquo;m still not managing to get up very early.
I should try and make 10 mins today to listen to waking up.

It&rsquo;s literally the easiest thing in the world




Today is one of the freeist days I&rsquo;ve had in ages. Looking into this HAZUS stuff will be good.
collapsed:: true

I need to not always make the same mistakes I&rsquo;ve made before I need to find a way to test it before I start making changes.

&ldquo;If they really card about us they would have bought all of us MBPs&rdquo;

If you feel that way ask MarioLane about what its like not to get paid because they all work 4 day weeks and have nice laptops.

You type mail then d * to delete everything, and save with q.

I have to finish the deck for Jules for tomorrow&rsquo;s meeting.
I also want to dive into Hazus


11:24

#nvim
collapsed:: true

Ok I burned a bunch of time faffin with nv. I can still make that work and it probably still is awesome but I have a long way left to go.
I think it&rsquo;s awesome and fast, but I kinda want to go back to nvim tree and maybe add the other language thing. I&rsquo;m to dumb to try and use the chadtree and coq thing.
Also I&rsquo;m just being an aold dada, but i don&rsquo;t find the vulagarity compelling.
literally the completion tool is &ldquo;cock now&rdquo;
Pretty wild.
That said I think following that NVChad things (as also dumb as it is) probably keeps me on the rails to where I want to be thing I can learn and build my way back
Upside is i got #Tmux going which is great.
lol #htop looks awsome as well.


What&rsquo;s my play here:

bathroom
activity routine.
presentation.
emails
Hazus




This presentation is an unmitigated disaster.

I wanted something totaly different to what Jules wanted.
I don&rsquo;t really care about the update. Which is kinda shitty of me.
July 1 is a big one. It should be us looking back over the year. but maybe we do the look back in Jan?
