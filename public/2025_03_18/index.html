#BlogIdeas

DONE Sort out my writing folder.
TODO Find some cool TLDs
TODO Brainstorm a name.

Will I ever find a name I&rsquo;m happy with?
Choosing a name is part of it.
I think leaning back on the Welsh will be fun.
I don&rsquo;t know if there is any famous welsh lore.
Maybe I stitch together the Norse mythology with the welsh spelling?
Wolf In welsh?
Sheep In wolfs clothing.
I wonder if there is a play on Alexander?
llyfr is the welsh word for Book.
Gwy is the word for wisdom, but a book is just what&rsquo;s published.
crwydro is to ramble


TODO Publish new Logseq entries under the blog heading to the website each day.
collapsed:: true

The very basic thing would be to just have a blank html template, then just keep appending markdown text to it.

To take the next step I would somehow need to convert the markdown to html
That probably isn&rsquo;t impossible provided that I have a theme.
Helvetica. Nothing beats Helvitica.
There is going to be some work to get pictures in there.




Is the easiest thing to be publishing to github pages?

Yes.
Is it where I want it No.
But it&rsquo;s about iteration.
Should I just be using github actions.
Probably.
Ok - Github actions is for public pages.

Maybe that&rsquo;s fine because I need to push a submodule for the page rather than the journal?







#Journal

TODO Add journaling placeholder text.
collapsed:: true

This would be a morning prompt / cron that adds a prompt to fill out standard journal entries.


TODO Is there a Spotify API so I can track my listens?
TODO Is there a youtube API so I can monitor my consumption?
TODO Can I get COROS Data off my watch?
DONE I should take a look at how LogSeq is organized.
collapsed:: true

Turns out it&rsquo;s just all journals and pages.
The current pla would be to  create a new program, and call it from cron tab.
Maybe this is a car hourse thing.
Do I have a personal AWS account. Yes. What is the best way to host a personal blog?
I could take a look at Marshals
Would serverless work, or is that really all I can for.
take request parse path params, and send back the html. Shrug.



TODO Get logseq on the phone.
collapsed:: true

Logseq Sync is a feature. It costs 5/mnth and takes some set up but that shouldn&rsquo;t be the end of the world.


TODO Hook up Logseq to Jira.
collapsed:: true

If something is under the #Work heading and TODO Create a Jira Ticket


TODO Try out the OpenAI Plugin.
TODO Publish a game to Steam?
Thor made a point that all the lua code for Hades was in plaintext with comments.
TODO It would be really cool to have a server in Bris that I could shell into.
